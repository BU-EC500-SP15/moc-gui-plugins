Intro:
Hello everyone. We are the Plugin-Architecture Group for the Massachusetts Open Cloud User Interface.
>>

[NEXT SLIDE]
>>
In the current cloud environment, most providers of cloud services are large entities that don't reveal internal data to researchers. This is a true bottleneck for progress in cloud computing.
>>
In contrast, the Massachusetts Open Cloud offers clear transparency to users of its services.
The MOC is a multi-university collaboration anchored in the Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center. 
>>

[NEXT SLIDE]
>>
Incubated at Boston University, the MGHPCC is a nationally unique model of collaboration that brings together industry, state government, and public and private universities around building and operating a research computing data center.
>>
For this Spring 2015 semester, we've been working on a user interface for Hardware-as-a-Service, or HaaS, a new public cloud offering from the Massachusetts Open Cloud. 
>>
[NEXT SLIDE]
Let's take a second to examine the Cloud Stack.
>>
A typical cloud stack offering is some combinations of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service.
>>
HaaS fits into the bottom of this abstraction.  
>>
HaaS is different because users can see and manage the actual machines doing the computations in the datacenter. We were able to integrate several critical HaaS APIs into the HaaS user interface, but this is still a work in progress, as is HaaS. 
>>

[NEXT SLIDE]
We will now give a quick overview of our project. 
>>
A HaaS server is being devloped by researchers here at Boston University. 
>>
We in turn are developing the plugin for the MOC UI for this HaaS server. We have used or developed API calls to interract with this HaaS server. 
>>
These projects are external to the MOC UI,  
>>
and will be intergrated into the MOC UI through the us of an iFrame, which we also developed.
>>

<NEXT SLIDE>
Due to its high interconnectivity, we will now take a second to explain the structure of the HaaS itself. Though this is just a simple abstraction, it is useful backround knowledge that influenced our design descisions.
>>
There are three main componetents of the HaaS, the projects, the nodes, and the Networks. 
>>
These main objects are connected in different ways. Projects can be directly connected to nodes, as can networks. Other, more narrow objects are involved as well.
>> 
An obect called a Network Interface Card connects nodes and networks.
>>
Headnodes must be connected to a project and a lesser object called a base image. 
>>
Similarly to nodes, headnodes are connected to networks by a lesser object called a Headnode Network Interface Card.
>>

<NEXT SLIDE>
One thing that we considered very important not jsut to the success of the project, but its quality, was the structure of its URLs. 
>>
Firstly, the three main objects described I just described are given their own urls. As everything stems from these three objects, they also form the base of our urls.
>>
We wanted to keep our urls consistant and intuitive. In order to see the details of one of the main three objects, one just puts it's respective type followed by its name. 
>>
Lesser objects like the ones we just described are viewed through the lens of the larger object it is associated with. We believe this is both true to the actual structure of HaaS as well as easy to understand. 
>>
<DEMO>
--------------------------------
[demonstrate MOC UI]
>>go to MOC main page without the integration
>>show the empty page
First, we want to show you how to integrate our HaaS UI. What you see now is the empty page from the MOC UI. As you can see, there is nothing. 
But integration is very simple.  All you need to do is add one line of HTML. Here we already commented what you need to add. 
So just uncomment this to integrate the iFrame. Now let's check if it actually works or not.

>>show the change in the MOC UI
>>a modal should pop up with our HaaS UI, this should be the projects tab
Yes! It works. So here are the three main components of the UI. Here we have a tab for each component. They are Projects, Nodes, and Networks. 
As you can see, there are some projects populated already. 

>>show Nodes tab
This is what the Nodes tab looks like. There are nodes already created.

>>show Networks tab
This is Networks. Here are the initialized networks. OK. Now I am going to walk through all the functionalities that we implemented. 

>>go to Projects tab
You can create new projects. You can view the details of already created projects. 

>>click on project details
Here you see the Nodes, the Headnodes, and Networks that are in the project selected.

>>click on back
Now let's create a new project.

>>click on create
OK.

>>type in "Coolest project ever?
How about "coolest project ever"? 

>>click on create
>>should see new project in Projects tab
As you can see, the project is created and is now listed.

>>click on manage for new project
Here is where you can attach new nodes to the project.
>>click on attach
As you can see, this is the list of all nodes that are available. 
We can add more nodes to the project. 
>>click attach
This time we can also detach a node from a project. So let's do that. How about we detach the first that we added from to the project?

>>click detach on first node added
OK. So that node is now detached. Now let's create a headnode for the project.

>>click on create under headnode section
The fields for creating a headnode are required.

>>enter "headnode10" for name
>>enter "img1" for image name
>>enter "Coolest project ever" for project name
Alright. Now let's manage our newly created headnode

>>click on manage for new headnode
Here you can register new HNICs. These are the Network Interface Cards for headnodes.

>>click on create
Now you need to specify the HNIC name.

>>enter "hnic1"
>>click create
Now I am going to create another one

>>click on create
>>enter "hnic2"
>>click create
OK. So now we have two headnodes. Now let's try to delete one of them. 

>>click delete for hnic2
hnic2 is now deleted. Now we are going back to project details page by clicking on back

>>click on "headnode10"
To view details of ta headnode you can click on it's name

Now, I will show you how to create and manage nodes.
>>click on Nodes tab
OK. I will show you how to view the node details.

>>click on "Node1"
Here is the list of NIC names and corresponding MAC address. You can see here whether or not a node is available.

>>click close
>>click manage on "Node1"
Here is where you can register new NICs.

>>click on register nic
Here you need to specify the NIC name, and its MAC Address

>>enter "NIC3" for NIC name
>>enter "00:44:55:fe:12:12"

>>click register
Now you see the newly registered NIC with the specified MAC address. OK. Now let's 

[DANA]

>>Click on networks tab
This tab shows all the networks (both private and public). Private networks are ones that are created for projects and public 
networks are not attached to any networks.

>> click on a network name
Click on a network name to view its details
>> Click on delete {{network}}
You can delete networks that are not connected to projects, networks or nics. If you click on "delete" for a project that is 
connected to either a project, a node or a headnode, an error message will appear. To delete a network you must confirm by entering it's name

>>click on create network
You can create a public network by just giving it a name

>>click on nodes tab
this tab shows all nodes, ones that are free and ones that are allocated to projects
>>click on create new -> enter values
You can create a new node
Once the node is created you can click on manage to add NICs to it
>>click on manage for the node you created
>>click on delete (at the bottom of the page) and enter the node name
You can delete this node by clicking on delete and confirming that this is the node you would like to delete.

<NEXT SLIDE>
The users of the MOC HaaS will be the students and researchers from the partner universities. Once HaaS is fully functional, we expect HaaS to be able to scale to tens of thousands of users. We have reached a point where we must pass the baton to future developers of the HaaS interface, and HaaS APIs.
